**Headline:** I built my own AI News Agent because I was tired of the noise. 🤖🗞️

**Body:**

Staying on top of AI right now feels like a full-time job. Between ArXiv drops, Product Hunt launches, and endless YouTube tutorials, the "FOMO" is real.

So I spent the weekend building a Python agent to automate my reading list.

Every morning, it runs on GitHub Actions and:
✅ Scans **ArXiv** for the top trending research papers.
✅ Aggregates generic **Global News** (TechCrunch, The Verge).
✅ Grabs the latest **YouTube** tutorials and **Reddit** discussions.
✅ Filters, deduplicates, and cleans everything up.

The Result?
A single, highly compact email. No "never-ending scroll."
Just the **Top 5 Highlights** per category with **3-line summaries** and thumbnails. If I want more, I can expand the list, but usually, I'm done in 2 minutes.

It’s been a game-changer for my morning routine. Pure signal, zero noise.

**I’m thinking of adding a few people to the distribution list.**
